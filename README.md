# Billboard Hot 100 Sentiment Analysis
#### Sentiment analysis of the lyrics from Billboard Hot 100 songs from 1965-2015
The objective of this project was to analyze and visualize a time series dataset. NLP was used to evaluate the emotion of each word in the song and assign each song an emotion rating based on the proportion between number of words with given emotion to total word count. Results were explored and visualized using d3.js.
